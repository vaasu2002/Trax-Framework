# Using Trax framework for making a deep neural network for sentiment analysis

In this project I will be using [**Trax Frame**](https://github.com/google/trax) which was developed by google.In Trax numpy operations can run very fast, as is uses
GPUs and TPUs to accelerate them. We can automatically compute gradients of functions ontensors. using `trax.fastmath` package thanks to its backends -- JAX and 
TensorFlow numpy.
