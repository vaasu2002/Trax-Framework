# Using Trax framework for making a deep neural network for sentiment analysis

In this project I will be using [**Trax Framework**](https://github.com/google/trax) which was developed by google.In Trax numpy operations can run very fast, as is uses
GPUs and TPUs to accelerate them. We can automatically compute gradients of functions ontensors. using `trax.fastmath` package thanks to its backends -- JAX and 
TensorFlow numpy.


I am attaching also made a notebook for understanding basic functions and syntax of Trax library. [Link to notebook](https://github.com/vaasu2002/Trax-Framework/blob/main/Introduction%20to%20Trax%20Framework.ipynb)
